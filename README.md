Software Engineering Project

This was a group project, website code will be added in another repository, the two were meant to be work together.

Website still has bugs but isnt being worked on anymore nor is this software. Database connection needs to be updated to
get this to work. This software was a rental equipment tracker where people can use the website to reserve equipment and then this software would be used in house where the equipment is stored as a way to check it out.
